i'm way too sad to dance
cause i got too caught up, my friends agree

A broken heart and nobody
And that's why I'm too sad to dance

And now I just wait by the telephone
You ain't coming back and I should've known

And that's why I'm too sad to dance
Oh, da-da-dum-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Dum-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

But you said you've heard it all before, mmm
And this Christmas, I got no gifts
